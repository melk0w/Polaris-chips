# Polaris-chips
A bunch of custom chips.

Hello my name is Dimitry and i want to show cool chip ideas for my tracker ðŸ˜œ!
1. Polaris PSG
Chip made in 1980 that have 4 channels
3 channels for square waves and 1 cannel
for 2 types of noise. First noise is used in TI SN76489 2nd noise used in AY8910 all types of noise have 1 bit length control.
It has 16-bit volume control. And exponential envelope control.
The biggest plus of this chip is
going to lower frequencies. For example the TI SN7 can't go below
A3 in contrast of Polaris PSG which can go above A(-1) and below A9!
The noise channel has 12 preset pitch.
2. Polaris PSGÂ² 
This chip made in 1984 and it very similar to NES' chip. It have 2 pwm channels (which are have 7 types of pulse 6.25 12.5 25 50 75 87.5 and 93.75) and linear envelope channel (it generates saw and triangle waves without volume control and square wave with volume control and without pwm) 
then it have noise channel with 4 types of noise + NES' and mettalic noises.
5th channel is for generating samples it has 8-bit pcm with resample amount 32000 hz. It can also make wavetables!
Like all Polaris' chips it have exponential volume control. The chip don't has frequency limits.
