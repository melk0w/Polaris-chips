Chip made in 1980 that have 4 channels
3 channels for square waves and 1 cannel
for 2 types of noise. First noise is used in TI SN76489 2nd noise used in AY8910 all types of noise have 1 bit lfsr control.
It has 4-bit volume control. And exponential envelope control.
The biggest plus of this chip is
going to lower frequencies. For example the TI SN7 can't go below 
A3 in contrast of Polaris PSG which can go below A(-1) and above A9!
The noise channel has 12 preset pitch.
Ok let's go to lfsr control, there's 2 options noise control for all types of noise.
