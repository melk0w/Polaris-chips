# Polaris-chips
A bunch of custom chips.

Hello my name is Dimitry and i want to show cool chip ideas for my tracker ðŸ˜œ!
1. Polaris PSG
Chip made in 1980 that have 4 channels
3 channels for square waves and 1 cannel
for 2 types of noise. First noise is used in TI SN76489 2nd noise used in AY8910 all types of noise have 1 bit length control.
It has 16-bit volume control. And exponential envelope control.
The biggest plus of this chip is
going to lower frequencies. For example the TI SN7 can't go below
A3 in contrast of Polaris PSG which is can go above A(-1) and below A9!
The noise channel has 12 preset pitch.
